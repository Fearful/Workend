Workend
=======

Pitch:
The idea of Workend comes from many hours spent looking at command prompts and over functional software. Merging, testing, cloning, etc. I’m Joan Lascano, Front-end Developer at Making Sense, and I love the web in all it’s glory.
The web 2.0 as we used to know it back in 2004 has changed, tools like nodejs, karma, bower and others have become a common base ground for many development projects.
Working with new technologies can be a little pain, having not only to deal with the git tools but also node, and every npm that exposes methods to the command prompt. 
Workend, aims to fill the gap between developers and the command prompt. It offers a simple UI where you can open/create/clone projects, you will be able to see your project statistics including test coverage, executable tasks available from gulpjs or grunt, news from github and manage your project status directly from the browser.
